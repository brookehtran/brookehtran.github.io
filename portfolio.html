        <h2>Game: Guardian of the Galaxy</h2>
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/259132991/#player">Try the game here!</a>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In the game, the player is the Guardian of the Galaxy.
        The user  is represented by a spaceship and must move left and right to dodge asteroids.
         After a certain amount of time that the game is played, the game will increase in 
         difficulty with the addition of a bigger ship to dodge. There was not a point system 
         but each time the player ship hit an asteroid, a health bar was used up. 
         There were only 4; each health bar was a life. The use of randomness was the number
         and amount of asteroids to dodge and where they would appear. The game ends when the player
         successfully dodges the asteroids for 45 seconds.The user loses when all of their health bars
         are depleted and they get the notification that their ship crashed. </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>The game was inspired by Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. The user sprite
        is the ship the Milano from the movie. The increase in difficulty feature includes
        another ship called the Dark Aster. The backstory of the game is from Avengers: Infinity War. 
        In regards to success in the development process of the game, there were basic features that
        were simple to implement.  When asteroids fell, it was easy to engineer a popping sounding to
        accompany the visuals. To produce many asteroids, randomization was used, and this was gone over
        in class. As for obstacles, there was difficulty in making the asteroid sprites fall down.  
        There was an error in the code; instead of using the “when touching edge,” x and y axises were 
        used and specific numbers were set. Another obstacle included the change from home screen to 
        backstory to game and to get it to reset once the game ended. This meant learning to broadcast
        messages. If there was more time and resources, the game could increase in difficulty and there
        would be other obstacles besides the asteroid. There could be levels to complete and a final mission
        on the Planet of Knowhere to retrieve the last Infinity Stone. </p>
        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <img src="algorithm.PNG">
        <p>This is an algorithm because it provides step by step directions for the system to make the game 
        run the way it is intended. When the rock (asteroid) is shown randomly (-240 to 240) on screen, it 
        will play a pop sound until it falls down to the end of the y-axis (-240) and disappears. Afterwards,
        clones will be created every 0.5 seconds and move around by -10 on the y-axis. If the user sprite 
        (ship) touches the asteroid until there are no lives left, the screen that indicates the end of the
        game appears. If the user is able to get through 40 seconds without losing any health bars, then the
        winner screen will appear and the ship script will stop moving.</p>

        <h2>CYOA: Cabin Trip</h2>
        <p>During this CYOA story, players arrive in Big Bear and stay in a cabin. A group of friends goes
        exploring and must decide on the fate of their friend once tragedy hits.</p>

        <h3>Program Development</h3>
        <p>The incremental development process of the program was creating a flowchart via Google drawings. 
        Doing this allowed us to break down the storyline and program into segments to code one part at a time. 
        Each segment was coded independently and, together, made a cohesive story. An example when of iterative 
        development in our program was having the player choose from two letters to advance the program. Also, 
        a difficulty we faced was structuring our story. Because we kept changing the story line throughout the 
        planning process and tried to change the code during that time, the flow of the story was affected. 
        We had to go back and recode different parts of the story to better organize the program. </p>
        <h3>Usage of Procedural Abstraction</h3>
        <p>By organizing our story into functions, a form of procedural abstraction, it makes the program 
        easier to read for users. Not only that, it allowed us to call the one function name rather than 
        rewriting the entire code. Each scene of the adventure is a form of the abstraction and each 
        represent its own function. </p>
        <h3>Other Stories</h3>
        <p>In regards to other stories, there was one that showed paragraphs typed up. After the long set
        up of the scene and characters, users were then able to choose an option to diverge from the story’s 
        main plot. I thought this was interesting. Having the story set up rather than giving users the option 
        to immediately change the characters’ actions was something not many stories had.</p>
